<p>If you're looking for a gun for hire to help you write some code, you're in the right place. If you're not, take a look at What do I do?</p>
<p>I can help you with your development projects, be they Web-based, Mobile, Desktop or deeper system-level requirements. I'm available by the hour or by the day, depending on your needs, do <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/contact-us/">get in contact</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
<p>Below is a basic overview of my skills, but you can see much more on <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidlumm">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<h1>Skills</h1>
<p>I'm a jack of all trades and a master at solving problems. Whilst I know a selection of technologies at the top of the skills pile are:</p>
<h2>C#</h2>
<p>My C# skills started in ASP.net, but have been grown in the desktop (Winforms and WPF), mobile (Windows Phone 8), web-services (WCF) and Windows services. I've also done a very small amount of ASP.net MVC and Web API.</p>
<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>I started my PHP career just 7 years ago and have since built a lot of public-facing websites (including bespoke ecommerce solutions) and internal line-of-business web applications. I have also used the SLIM framework to build websites and RESTful APIs.</p>
<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>Javascript is one of those languages that people either love or hate, I find myself in the former camp. I'm always surprised at how powerful a language it is, somewhat wasted for so many years doing simple client-side operations, it's nice to see just how widespread it has become.</p>
<p>My pure javascript is strong, I also have plenty of experience with jQuery, however up until recently I've had very little experience with any of the popular frontend frameworks - for that reason I've started experimenting with Aurelia, which I'm finding fascinating!</p>
<p>I've also had a little experience with Cordova/PhoneGap.</p>
<h2>Also...</h2>
<p>Worth also mentioning are: VB.net, ActionScript, Python, Java, SQL</p>
<p>I consider myself a polyglot programmer, able to pick up new languages and technologies relatively quickly, so as long as it has some documentation I should be able to get stuck into whatever stack you need help with. I learn best when thrown in at the deep end.</p>
<p>Just drop me a message if you're interested in <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/contact-us/">hiring me</a>.</p>
