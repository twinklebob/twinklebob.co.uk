<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I’m David Lumm and I’m the person behind TwinkleBob Solutions. I want to help your business refocus on the things that matter most and use technology to take care of as much of the rest as possible, when you get it right it will make your life easier and your business more profitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all started life as a small-scale web development hobby and has grown over time as I developed my skill set and found my niche. I’ve spent the majority of my working life as a software developer including some time doing automation projects and integrating different systems (getting them to talk to each other to achieve more with less human input) and I found that I enjoyed helping a business to be more efficient. I still do some development (you can hire me as a contractor), but I’m hoping to use my skills to help other small businesses to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up as the home computer explosion happened, with the early days of the internet, watching lots of science fiction. I totally bought into the vision of the future presented by programmes like The Jetsons and Star Trek; sometimes I’m a little bit disappointed with how far we’ve managed to come since then! On the other hand, I’m quite happy to sit down with a good old-fashioned book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience, small business owners tend to be passionate specialists. They’ve gone into business because they are good at what they do and enjoy doing it. However running a business involves more than the bits that we enjoy. Things can get worse when we’re spending most of our effort doing those tasks instead of the ones that we enjoy and earn us money. It just so happens that I enjoy helping a business solve these problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a company, TwinkleBob Solutions has only been trading since March 2016, but I’ve been playing with technology for a lot longer! Oh, and if you want to know the story behind the name, you’ll have to ask me in person - the story is too embarrassing to put on the internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I’m not working, I’m enjoying all that Cornwall has to offer with my wife, son and labrador.</span></p>
