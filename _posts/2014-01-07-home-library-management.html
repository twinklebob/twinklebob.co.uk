<p>I love books, we have quite a lot at home, covering a wide range of subjects, plus a lot of fiction books and children's books. We don't mind lending them out, but eventually it becomes quite hard to keep track of them all: where's this book, is it in the living room, the study, does someone else have it? etc.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when I still had a desktop PC at home, I used to use a program called <a title="Tellico" href="http://tellico-project.org/" target="_blank">Tellico</a> to help me manage my collection of books. The upside, it had cover pictures and could record the locations of the books, it could even export the entire collection to a static webpage so I could share it with friends. But without a barcode scanner I had to type in the ISBN for each book manually.</p>
<p>I don't generally use a desktop or a laptop at home these days, I prefer to use my phone and my tablet to do most tasks. We've got books spread over 3 bookcases in 2 rooms, plus a pile of children's books in my child's room. So I decided I'd look at doing this again.</p>
<p>So I went looking for an app to do it. It needed to do a few things for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow ISBN scanning with the phone camera</li>
<li>Automatically look up book details</li>
<li>Record the location the book is stored</li>
<li>Synchronise across devices</li>
<li>Provide a web interface so friends and family can see what we've got and whether it's available or not</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn't find anything that perfectly fit the bill although <a title="Libramatic" href="http://www.libramatic.com/" target="_blank">Libramatic</a> came pretty close. It was missing the all-important location setting, at least at the free level. The website isn't entirely clear on what you get for your â‚¬29.99 a month. In addition, a lot of the interaction once a book has been entered is using it's unique reference - something that would make sense in a library with lots of copies of the same book, but not so much at home.</p>
<p>So I decided that the time is right for me to have another crack at mobile development, it's been a more than two years since my last failed attempt. I'm looking to use PhoneGap for the clients so I can write for both Android and iOS, with PHP for the backend and I'm hoping to record some of the journey here.</p>
<p>I'm going to release the source code under the MIT licence, so that others can make use of it, although if it's any good I may also charge for premium features.</p>
<p>The project is called Lyverva, which is Cornish for Library. I have a fascination with the Cornish language, but not a vast knowledge of it, yet.</p>
<p>I could do with your help guiding the project so I'd appreciate if you could fill in this <a title="Lyverva Survey" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kXr-BvWWRWPkL8TvzMkBnXmAUBFE2CVDz9Dk05zcdGM/viewform" target="_blank">quick survey</a> for me.</p>
<p>The projects are on GitHub as <a title="Lyverva PHP Backend Server (GitHub)" href="https://github.com/twinklebob/lyverva-server" target="_blank">lyverva-server</a> and <a title="Lyverva PhoneGap Client (GitHub)" href="https://github.com/twinklebob/lyverva-client" target="_blank">lyverva-client</a>, although they're pretty bare bones at the moment so they might not make much sense.</p>
