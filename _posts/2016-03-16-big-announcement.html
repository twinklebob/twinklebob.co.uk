<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m incredibly pleased to announce that as of 12th March 2016 TwinkleBob Solutions is officially a registered company and that I, </span><a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/about/about-david/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Lumm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, am it’s Director!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been playing with this TwinkleBob thing as a hobby project for at least 15 years; it provided me pocket money when I was doing my A-Levels and a little extra cash when I was a struggling student, but as I got into working full time and starting a family it started to get more and more neglected. Recently I’ve tried to perk up this site and decide what it was I really wanted to offer in hopes that I might be able to find a viable business.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-144" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picjumbo.com_HNCK8991-1024x683.jpg" alt="Businessman" width="620" height="414" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 8 years of programming, project managing and strategising as someone else’s employee, I felt like it was time to take the leap into TwinkleBob full time. As a happy side effect, this also allows me to make some adjustments to my work/life balance and spend more time with my wife, 4 year old and labrador puppy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this is now my full time role, that means that I can confidently offer the following services:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bespoke software development (including Web and Mobile)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology audit, analysis and strategy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology support</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps some of the recent blog posts will have inspired you?
