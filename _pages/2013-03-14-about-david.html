<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignright size-medium" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/10d0a7cca3e3839297b1e5050c165dc4.jpg?s=200" width="200" height="200" />I have a love/hate relationship with technology. I grew up as the home computer explosion happened, with the early days of the internet, watching lots of science fiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I totally bought into the vision of the future presented by programmes like The Jetsons and Star Trek; sometimes I’m a little bit disappointed with how far we’ve managed to come since then! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve worked in user support and as a professional developer (I still do some of that, you can hire me as <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/contractor/">a contractor</a>) but my passion is big picture thinking, helping people work out how the whole puzzle goes together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love technology, but it needs to be helping you or it’s just not worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a couple of things I love even more than technology: my family and the cornish countryside.</span></p>
