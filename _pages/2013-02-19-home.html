<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi, I’m <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/about/about-david/">David Lumm</a> and I’m the person behind TwinkleBob Solutions. I want to make your technology work for you, to make your life easier and your business more profitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience, small business owners tend to be passionate specialists. They know their trade very well; but sometimes what they don’t know is technology; for a lot of people it can be scary and complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re a small business looking for advice on which laptop to buy (do you even need a laptop?), which CRM system will work best with your current website and ePOS (or do you need to replace all three?) or how you can automate that annoying task you do every single day, I’m here to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start making decisions based on differing opinions or incorrect assumptions, you end up with lots of different things that don’t work together. This spaghetti of technology gets complicated too quickly, too easily. At this point it becomes a huge drain on resources, especially those things that small businesses can have very little of: time and money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of me as a temporary <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/technology-officer/">Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</a> who you can bring in when needed. Why should the big businesses get all the expertise?</span></p>
