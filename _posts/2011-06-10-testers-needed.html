<p>We're currently working on an app with <a title="COUNT THE KICKS" href="http://www.countthekicks.org.uk/">COUNT THE KICKS</a>™ but due to a couple of issues we're currently behind schedule. We were hoping to have the first release ready by this sort of time, but we're not quite there yet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we're going to be looking for some beta testers to have a go with the software and help us improve it. We need just a couple of users for each platform: iOS, WebOS, Android, Symbian and BlackBerry (OS 5.0 and above). If you're on Symbian or BlackBerry, you need to have a touch phone in order to use the interface.</p>
<p>If you're interested in testing for us, please use the <a title="Sign up as a tester" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGlJWU9WajVOTzl6SUpyZHlpWndSdHc6MQ" target="_blank">form to sign up</a>.</p>
