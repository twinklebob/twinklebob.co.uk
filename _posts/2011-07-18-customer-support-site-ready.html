<p>Well we might have not yet got the app out (although it's moving along nicely and the beta version should be ready soon) but we've got a customer support site for the COUNT THE KICKS™ mobile app thanks to <a title="Google Moderator" href="http://goo.gl/mod/G00p" target="_blank">Google Moderator</a>.</p>
<p>The <a title="COUNT THE KICKS™ App Support" href="http://goo.gl/mod/G00p" target="_blank">customer support site</a> will allow users of the app to report problems, ask questions and suggest new features - what's also great is that Google Moderator allows other users to rate the questions/suggestions that other people are making. That way we can see which features people are most interested in and get those working first!</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://goo.gl/mod/G00p" target="_blank">support site</a> today and if you haven't already, perhaps consider <a title="Testers needed" href="http://blog.twinklebob.co.uk/?p=22" target="_blank">becoming a tester</a> for us to get your hands on the first release of the app!</p>
