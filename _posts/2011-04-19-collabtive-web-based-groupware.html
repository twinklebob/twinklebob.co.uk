<p>Collabtive is a surprisingly powerful open source PHP-based project management solution, one that I've started using in-house with some of my upcoming projects (watch this space!) but according to the <a title="Collabtive at Open Dynamics" href="http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/" target="_blank">main site</a> and the <a title="Open Dynamics Collabtive on GitHub" href="https://github.com/rphl/collabtive" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> there has been no releases since August 2010.</p>
<p>The software is pretty good as it is, but it's lacking a few features for me - one of the main things I'd like to add is the option for per-project wiki and maybe a global wiki too. Also the default theme is a bit dark and the only other pre-installed theme actually breaks things, so I'd like to try and do something about that.</p>
<p>Given that it's open source and already on GitHub I've taken the liberty of forking the existing project and I'm going to start adding the features I'd like to see.</p>
<p>So if you'd like to see the TwinkleBob version of Collabtive, check outÂ <a href="https://github.com/twinklebob/collabtive">https://github.com/twinklebob/collabtive</a> and feel free to get involved!</p>
