<p>If you know roughly what you want and you need someone to help you deliver that project, you're in the right place. If you're a software company after a coder, you can <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/contractor/">hire me on contract</a>. If you want someone to help you with your whole technology affairs, maybe you'd be interested in <a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/technology-officer/">hiring me as a Technology Officer</a>.</p>
<p>We can help you deliver a range of projects, whether you're after a new website, a bespoke application or a plugin or module for an existing platform.</p>
<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>TwinkleBob Solutions have a long history of developing websites of various types, purposes andÂ styles. We can work with you to put together a site that works well for you and is appealing to it's users. Some of the types of website we can build for you are listed below:</p>
<h2>Simple Site</h2>
<p>You may just want a simple site with a couple of pages of content that is not likely to change very often, perhaps you already have hosting for this or you may want us to take care of the domain and the hosting. We can do both creation and full management.</p>
<h2>Content Management Site</h2>
<p>This is ideal for those people who want to be able to keep their site up-to-date but don't want to deal with the nuts and bolts of keeping it running. As a general rule we use WordPress as a basis for our CMS sites, but can use other platforms if required.</p>
<p>This is our most popular standalone product, presumably because it gives our customers free reign over their website without having to worry about the nuts and bolts of keeping a website running.</p>
<h2>e-Commerce</h2>
<p>If you're in the market for an online marketplace, we can help you out. We can use an existing platform or build you something from scratch and can interact with any payment processor you require and connect with any back-end processes as required.</p>
<p>If you require anything more complicated than the above, you may want to consider <a title="Contact Us" href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/technology-officer/">hiring us</a> to provide a whole system review, repair and augmentation.</p>
<h1>Mobile Development</h1>
<p>As well as website development, which we can target at mobile devices if appropriate/required, we can also create mobile apps. These can be created for any of the major platforms: Apple's iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8. Other platforms may also be possible, if required.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more than a standalone app, it may be more appropriate for us to <a title="Services" href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/technology-officer/">look at your whole system</a> and determine a course of action that will serve you best.</p>
