<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas Adams, author of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series, once wrote “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Science fiction has promised us that by now we’ll be comfortably idle, sitting back whilst technology takes care of us, yet here we are bogged down in more technology and working just as hard as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a problem for big businesses and for small businesses, however the difference is that the large companies have larger budgets and people whose job it is to think about these things, smaller companies rarely have such luxury. However, I can help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s possible in a few companies to get by with very little technology, but for the rest there are decisions to be made, equipment to be bought and processes to be laid down. If you’re an expert in making raw chocolate, you might not be able to solve those problems as easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me tell you one example problem I helped to solve: A small factory had an ecommerce website, a production management system and a team taking telephone orders. Each had a separate evolution, created by different teams to serve different purposes, except over time they had been brought together in a perfect example of the spaghetti approach: Orders came in through the website and were emailed to one member of the order team. That person had the responsibility of printing out those emails once a day and distributing through the rest of the team. The team members would then go through the email, re-entering the order details into the production system to push the order through the factory. I doubt that company are alone in these sorts of processes that have evolved out of ideas that were supposed to help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that company I developed a system that would connect the ecommerce website and production systems together, automatically cutting out huge delays and additional workforce that had to be hired at peak times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m available as a temporary Chief Technology Officer, or perhaps you could call me a Technology Consultant or Advisor. As a friend of mine once said, I don’t care what you call me as long as you don’t call me late for dinner. I’m here to step in when you need me and step out when you don’t.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does it cost?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I offer a bespoke service and charge by the hour. I’m happy to have an honest conversation with you about your specific requirements, queries, budget and the potential cost savings to your business by taking me on; just a few hours of my time will help you reclaim a lot more of yours in the future.</span></p>
