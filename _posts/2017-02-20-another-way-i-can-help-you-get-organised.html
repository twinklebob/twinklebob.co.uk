<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards the back end of last year, I was offered the opportunity to qualify as an Evernote Certified Consultant, which enables me to work with Evernote users (particularly business users) with a stamp of approval from </span><a href="https://evernote.com/upgrade/?tier=premium&amp;origin=ebcc&amp;offer=cc_dlumm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evernote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">*.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evernote is a great tool that I will rave about to anyone that will listen, client or not. It’s a great way to help individuals or business get organised and can make retrieving information much quicker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been using Evernote personally for about 7 years to collect thoughts, documents, websites, lists and all manner of things. It’s greatest strengths, in my experience, are its flexibility and searchability. It doesn’t matter if I’m looking for a scanned document, a photo of a whiteboard, a typed note or a clipped web page, I can always find what I’m looking for! It’s why I’m always trying to find ways to </span><a href="http://twinklebob.co.uk/almost-paper-free-part-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put more things into it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I’m working with a business to see how we can use technology to help them spend more time working on, rather than in, the business this usually covers five different strands: organise, rationalise, simplify, streamline and automate. It’s often possible to make big wins, particularly in the first three or four, without spending a lot of additional money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evernote has always been something I’ve offered to a lot of customers as a tool to help them get organised - even the free basic package can be a great start. It will be great to be able to work with businesses more closely in that respect with the full backing of Evernote and access to their resources. If you’re in a business with more than 3 people then Evernote Business has additional features that I would also be happy to discuss with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be writing more about the potential benefits of Evernote as well as other ways you can focus on what matters most to your business and less on those things that seem to drain your time and money.</span></p>
