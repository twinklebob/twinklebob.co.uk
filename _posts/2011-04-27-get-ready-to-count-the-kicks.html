<p>I've started a new mobile project with the <a title="COUNT THE KICKS" href="http://www.countthekicks.org.uk/">COUNT THE KICKS</a>™ campaign and we're aiming for first release on the 13th of June 2011!</p>
<p>The app will be a pregnancy support app with particular focus on movement/kick tracking - there will be a free version at first, with a Pro version set for release about the middle of August.</p>
<p>The App will be released on iOS, Android and WebOS at first, with BlackBerry, Symbian and possibly Windows Phone 7 to follow.</p>
<p>Watch this space!</p>
