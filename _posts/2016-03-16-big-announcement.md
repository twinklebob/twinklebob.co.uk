I’m incredibly pleased to announce that as of 12th March 2016 TwinkleBob Solutions is officially a registered company and that I, [David Lumm](http://twinklebob.co.uk/about/about-david), am it’s Director!

I’ve been playing with this TwinkleBob thing as a hobby project for at least 15 years; it provided me pocket money when I was doing my A-Levels and a little extra cash when I was a struggling student, but as I got into working full time and starting a family it started to get more and more neglected. Recently I’ve tried to perk up this site and decide what it was I really wanted to offer in hopes that I might be able to find a viable business.

After 8 years of programming, project managing and strategising as someone else’s employee, I felt like it was time to take the leap into TwinkleBob full time. As a happy side effect, this also allows me to make some adjustments to my work/life balance and spend more time with my wife, 4 year old and labrador puppy!

As this is now my full time role, that means that I can confidently offer the following services:

* Bespoke software development (including Web and Mobile)
* Technology audit, analysis and strategy
* Technology support
