<p>I've written an article for <a title="Geek-Speak - Pure Geekery" href="http://www.geek-speak.co.uk/2013/03/ifttt-automation-for-the-web/" target="_blank">Geek-Speak.co.uk</a> about the usefulness of IFTTT.com as a tool for integration and automation for both our online and off-line worlds.</p>
<p>Automation and Integration are a big passion of mine and a big part of what I do with TwinkleBob Solutions, if this is something you're interested in you may find the article an interesting read. Once you've read it, pop back here and <a title="Contact Us" href="http://blog.twinklebob.co.uk/contact-us/" target="_blank">hire me</a> to help you out with your own software needs.</p>
