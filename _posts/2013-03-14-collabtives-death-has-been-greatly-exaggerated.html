<p>So it seems like Collabtive, the open source project management platform that I use and have promoted here in the past, is not nearly as dead as I thought it was!</p>
<p>It turns out I had found (and had been following) a <a href="https://github.com/rphl/collabtive" target="_blank">different repository on GitHub</a> and not an official one. The official <a href="https://github.com/philippK-de/Collabtive" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> seems to show that it was last updated within the last week.</p>
<p>This is great news and as soon as I get a chance I'll be updating the version I'm running, I'll also look at maybe getting involved in it's development.</p>
